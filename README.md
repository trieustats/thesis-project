This repository contains the code lines and raw data for my capstone research at university. The thesis is Marketing-based whose name is "Analysis of student satisfaction and the progress in their performance at an IELTS center in Vietnam". I collected the data from McIELTS center. Then I used Cronbachâ€™s Alpha, Pearson correlation test, multiple linear regression, and t-test to analyze the data. I also visualized the data using carto colors to help color blind people read my thesis with ease.  
The raw data can be found in data file.txt. 
Open your R studio, copy the codes from analysis.Rmd and proceed.
